  "raceContext": "United States GP (Circuit of the Americas) \u2013 race-weekend context\nEvent dates: Friday\u2013Sunday, October 17\u201319, 2025 (Austin, Texas). Sprint weekend format. Grand Prix start: Sunday 14:00 local (UTC\u20115). Key F1 sessions: FP1 Fri 12:30\u201313:30; Sprint Qualifying Fri 16:30; Sprint Sat 12:00; Grand Prix Qualifying Sat 16:00.\n\nWeather (latest outlook for race weekend \u2013 Austin, TX)\nNote: this is a long\u2011range outlook (issued Oct 5) and confidence will increase inside 5 days.\n- Friday (Oct 17): Partly sunny; high ~81\u00b0F/27\u00b0C, low ~55\u00b0F/13\u00b0C. \n- Saturday (Oct 18): Mostly sunny and warm; high ~85\u00b0F/29\u00b0C, low ~60\u00b0F/16\u00b0C. \n- Sunday (Oct 19 \u2013 race): Mostly sunny, warm; high ~84\u00b0F/29\u00b0C, low ~58\u00b0F/14\u00b0C. \n- Wind and rain probability: Early long\u2011range guidance points to light southerly breezes around 7\u201312 mph and low precipitation odds; typical October wind in Austin averages ~7 mph. We\u2019ll refine gusts/PoP mid\u2011week.\n\nTrack characteristics and key corners\n- 5.513 km, anti\u2011clockwise, 20 turns; signature 41 m (\u2248134 ft) climb to Turn 1 hairpin. First sector \u201cesses\u201d (T3\u20116) echo Silverstone/Suzuka; heavy\u2011brake pass into T12 at end of the long back straight; multi\u2011apex T16\u201118 and track\u2011limits hotspot at T19. Two DRS zones (runs to T1 and T12).\n- Surface/limits updates: large portions were resurfaced ahead of 2024 and \u201cfake gravel\u201d added at some corners to curb track\u2011limits abuse; resurfacing sought to smooth long\u2011standing bumps.\n- Local notes: COTA is wind\u2011sensitive and punishing on lateral load through the fast S\u2011curves; traction critical out of T11 onto the back straight.\n\nHistorical Safety Car/incident profile\n- Full Safety Car deployed in 2013 (Lap 1), 2014 (Lap 1), 2015 (Laps 27 & 43), 2022 (Laps 18 & 22), and 2024 (Lap 2). VSCs in 2015, 2016, 2018, 2021. No red\u2011flagged USGP at COTA to date.\n\nStrategy considerations\n- Tyre compounds (2025): Pirelli has nominated C1 (Hard), C3 (Medium), C4 (Soft) for Austin, skipping C2. Expect meaningful pace gap between compounds and some setup trade\u2011offs across Sprint/GP.\n- Pit lane loss: ~20 seconds; short delta lends flexibility for two\u2011stop responses to deg or Safety Car.\n- Likely race plans: Historically variable. COTA often trends to 2\u2011stop on C2/C3/C4 with soft of limited race use, but a one\u2011stop can win if temps and degradation cooperate (Ferrari did so in 2024). Teams typically start on Medium and extend to open options; Hards favored for long stints.\n- Sprint parc ferm\u00e9: In 2025 the Sprint is a standalone event with parc ferm\u00e9 \u201cunlocked\u201d between the Sprint and Saturday GP qualifying, allowing setup changes; cars are otherwise locked from Sprint Qualifying through the Sprint and again from GP Qualifying to the race. This eases some 2023\u2011style setup traps on bumpy surfaces.\n\nRecent race history at COTA (last 3 editions)\n- 2024: Charles Leclerc won (Ferrari) from Carlos Sainz; Max Verstappen P3 after Lando Norris received a 5s penalty. Largely one\u2011stop strategies; Safety Car on Lap 2. Pole: Norris. Fastest lap: Esteban Ocon.\n- 2023: Max Verstappen won (Red Bull). Lewis Hamilton (P2 on road) and Charles Leclerc (P6) were disqualified post\u2011race for plank wear amid bumpy surface/Sprint\u2011weekend setup constraints.\n- 2022: Max Verstappen won (Red Bull) from Hamilton and Leclerc in a two\u2011Safety\u2011Car race.\n\nUnique challenges for teams and drivers\n- Bumps and compliance: Despite resurfacing, ride\u2011height/window sensitivity remains a theme; 2023 DSQs underscored risk around skid\u2011block wear when parc ferm\u00e9 restricts changes.\n- Wind and track limits: Crosswinds through the first\u2011sector S\u2011curves can destabilize balance; T19 and T12 are frequent limits hotspots.\n- Thermal degradation: Long, high\u2011speed sequences load the fronts; traction demands out of T11/T20 stress rears, pushing teams toward Medium/Hard focus and careful energy management.\n\nPractice/qualifying status (as of Sunday, Oct 5, 2025)\n- No Austin sessions yet. Next F1 on\u2011track is FP1 in Austin on Friday, Oct 17. It is a Sprint weekend (Sprint Qualifying Friday; Sprint Saturday noon local).\n\nLatest F1 form guide and news heading into Austin\n- Singapore GP (Oct 5): George Russell won for Mercedes ahead of Max Verstappen; Lando Norris P3. McLaren clinched the 2025 Constructors\u2019 Championship with six rounds remaining; in Drivers\u2019, Oscar Piastri leads Norris by 22 points, Verstappen further back. Austin is next.\n- Austin 2025 is a Sprint event per the official 2025 Sprint calendar, with the detailed session timetable published (see above).\n\nQuick reference \u2013 overtaking and operations\n- Primary passing: DRS to T12 (best), plus T1 hairpin; 78 race\u2011overtakes were logged in 2023. Pit loss \u224820.3 s; 2 DRS zones.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can refresh the forecast mid\u2011week (Oct 13\u201315) to add precise wind/PoP/gusts and update Sprint/GP tyre usage once Pirelli\u2019s pre\u2011event notes land.",

  "raceContext": "Here\u2019s the latest race\u2011weekend context for the 2025 Singapore Grand Prix (race: Sunday, October 5, 20:00 local time, SGT).\n\nHeadline updates (as of Saturday, Oct 4)\n- Qualifying: George Russell on pole for Mercedes; Max Verstappen P2; Oscar Piastri P3; Kimi Antonelli P4; Lando Norris P5; Lewis Hamilton P6; Charles Leclerc P7. Williams pair Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz Jr were disqualified from qualifying over DRS rear\u2011wing non\u2011compliance and will start from the back.\n- Practice: FP3 topped by Verstappen; FP2 led by Piastri after a red\u2011flag\u2011hit session (Russell crash, Lawson incident, Leclerc/Norris pit\u2011lane contact).\n- Heat Hazard: FIA declared F1\u2019s first \u201cheat hazard\u201d event this weekend; drivers can use cooling vests or add ballast. Mandatory in 2026\u2011onward events meeting the trigger.\n- Circuit/operations tweaks: Singapore has four DRS zones (including T14\u2013T16 added for 2024 and retained), aiding overtaking prospects. Several sections resurfaced since 2024. Reports this year also indicate a widened pit lane and 80 km/h pit\u2011lane limit at this event (reducing pit\u2011stop time).\n\nWeather (race\u2011relevant)\n- Sunday race (Oct 5, 20:00 SGT): Partly cloudy, hot and humid; race\u2011start temperature near 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F). Rain chance around 20% (light showers risk); winds light southerly to east\u2011southeasterly around 2\u20136 mph (3\u201310 km/h). Overnight humidity high (70\u201380%+). Hour\u2011by\u2011hour services show low shower probabilities through 20:00\u201323:00.\n\nTrack characteristics and key corners\n- Layout: Marina Bay Street Circuit, 4.927 km, 62 laps, 19 corners; high downforce, heavy braking/traction focus, bumpy public roads, night race. Main overtaking spots: T7 (after DRS), the T13\u2013T14\u2013T16 sequence with back\u2011to\u2011back DRS to T16, and into T1 at the start/finish. The 2023 works removed the old T16\u2013T19 complex, creating a long straight that remains in use.\n- Four DRS zones: start/finish, T5\u2013T7, T13\u2013T14, plus the newer T14\u2013T16 zone (added in 2024).\n- Notable corners for rhythm/tyre stress: T7 heavy stop; T11\u201312 direction change towards Anderson Bridge; T13 hairpin over the bridge; T16 braking at end of the long straight; T18/19 still tricky on traction into the final corner.\n\nHistorical Safety Car profile\n- Singapore is traditionally a Safety\u2011Car magnet; the 2024 race was the first to run without a Safety Car or even a yellow flag. Across 2008\u20132024 there have been 24 SC deployments in 15 races (i.e., ~93% of races featured an SC). Expectation remains elevated for neutralisations, even if the 2023\u20132024 layout made the race somewhat cleaner.\n\nTyres and strategy\n- Pirelli selection: C3 (Hard) / C4 (Medium) / C5 (Soft). Thermal degradation and overheating are the primary limits; Medium and Hard are the race compounds of choice, with Soft more situational (launch or late SC).\n- Baseline approach: one\u2011stop remains the reference (start Medium \u2192 switch Hard roughly mid\u2011distance), but the high SC/VSC likelihood plus a (reported) 80 km/h pit\u2011lane limit this year can open two\u2011stop options. Teams will also keep a late\u2011race Soft in hand in case of a neutralisation.\n- Pit\u2011loss/undercut: With a faster pit lane (vs. the 60 km/h used previously), the time loss is reduced, marginally improving undercut viability\u2014especially as track evolution is strong at night. However, track position and clean air still dominate.\n\nRecent race history (last three editions)\n- 2024: Lando Norris won from pole, ahead of Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri. First Singapore GP without a Safety Car or yellow flag; Daniel Ricciardo set fastest lap.\n- 2023: Carlos Sainz won (Ferrari) using the \u201cDRS tow\u201d defence over Norris; Hamilton P3.\n- 2022: Sergio P\u00e9rez won in the wet/dry race ahead of Leclerc and Sainz (retained win despite post\u2011race SC penalty).\n\nUnique challenges this weekend\n- Heat/humidity and cockpit heat load: FIA\u2019s \u201cheat hazard\u201d declaration underscores driver cooling and hydration management; fatigue and concentration fade are real risks late in the race.\n- Night street circuit: narrow walls, uneven surfaces, frequent 90\u2011degree braking zones, and painted road markings reduce grip (especially if showers hit). Track evolution is steep across sessions.\n- Overtaking still difficult: Four DRS zones help, but securing track position in qualifying\u2014and managing tyres to defend traction zones\u2014remains decisive.\n\nAdditional competitive context\n- Mercedes pace spike: Russell\u2019s pole and Antonelli P4 suggest the team\u2019s latest aero updates are working here. Verstappen voiced frustration over traffic in Q3; McLaren remains in range to wrap the Constructors\u2019 title with a modest points haul on Sunday.\n- Scrutineering: Williams\u2019 double DQ for DRS non\u2011compliance reshuffles the rear of the grid; they start from the back.\n- FP3 incidents/discipline: Verstappen topped FP3; Hamilton was investigated over a red\u2011flag scenario in FP3 but avoided sanction.\n\nAt\u2011a\u2011glance race brief for preview writers\n- Start time: Sunday Oct 5, 20:00 SGT (local).\n- Weather at race start: ~30\u00b0C, humid, slight shower risk (~20%), light winds E/SE 2\u20136 mph.\n- Track: 4.927 km, 62 laps, 19 turns; four DRS zones (S/F, T5\u20137, T13\u201314, T14\u201316).\n- Tyres: C3/C4/C5; likely 1\u2011stop (M\u2192H) but SC/VSC could swing to 2\u2011stop or late Soft dash.\n- Safety Car outlook: Historically very high (all but 2024); plan flexible strategies.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor a one\u2011page brief for your publication\u2019s style (with grid lines, likely stoppers, and team\u2011by\u2011team talking points).",
